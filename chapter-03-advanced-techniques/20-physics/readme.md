# Three.js Physics Playground

Interactive physics simulation built with Three.js and Cannon.js. Drop spheres and boxes, watch them collide with realistic physics, and hear impact sounds that vary based on collision strength.

ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://threejs-physics-playground.netlify.app/)

## Features
- Realistic gravity and collision simulation
- Dynamic object creation (spheres and boxes)
- Collision sounds with volume based on impact strength
- Automatic cleanup of fallen objects
- GUI interface for easy interaction:
  - Create random-sized spheres and boxes
  - Reset the simulation at any time
  - Adjust object removal height threshold

## Tech Stack
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Cannon.js for physics simulation
- lil-gui for controls
- Vite for development and building

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server
