# Three.js Journey Projects

Projects and exercises from [Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey course](https://threejs-journey.com/).

## Description
This repository contains my implementation of projects and exercises while learning Three.js. Each chapter focuses on different aspects of 3D web development using Three.js. Some projects include additional documentation and live demos.

## Project Structure
Repository is organized by chapters, each containing multiple projects. Every project has its own folder with source code, and some include additional README files with descriptions and deployment links. Since projects vary in complexity and technology stack (vanilla JS, React, etc.), their internal structure might differ. The simplified structure below illustrates the basic organization:

```bash
chapter-XX-name/
└── project-folder/
    ├── src/
    └── README.md (when applicable)
```

## Live Demos
Collection of deployed projects from this course:
- Chapter 2 (Classic Techniques) 
  - Lights [Demo](https://threejs-lights-playground.netlify.app/)
  - Shadows [Demo](https://threejs-shadows-playground.netlify.app/)

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- WebGL
